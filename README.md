# User Management System  

## Overview  
The **User Management System (UMS)** is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) user data. It is designed with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and user-friendly interfaces. This project demonstrates practical implementation of the MERN stack and server-side rendering using View Engine.  

## Features  
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user data.  
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.  
- **Backend API:** RESTful APIs implemented using Node.js and Express for seamless data handling.  
- **Database Integration:** MongoDB used for efficient and scalable user data management.  
- **Server-Side Rendering:** View Engine integrated for dynamic content updates and enhanced interactivity.  
- **Validation:** Robust input validation to maintain data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema management)  
- **View Engine:** Used for rendering dynamic content
